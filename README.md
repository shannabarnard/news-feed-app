# News Feed App


### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Start Dev Server

```
npm start
```


### Features:

- ES6 Support via [babel](https://babeljs.io/) (v7)
- JavaScript Linting via [eslint-loader](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader)
- SASS Support via [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader)
- Autoprefixing of browserspecific CSS rules via [postcss](https://postcss.org/) and [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- Style Linting via [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)


### Scaffolding:
I have used [webpack-starter](https://github.com/wbkd/webpack-starter) to scaffold this app.

#### Validation (for webpack-starter)

- It's great!
- Keeping things simple.
- Allowing focus on semantics (html), styling (CSS) and logic (JavaScript) while making the assumption in a team we would architect together, therefore mitigating the need to over think this now.
