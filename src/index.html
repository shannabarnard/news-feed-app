  <h1>Hire me. Â¡Por favor!</h1>
  <p>This is my initial commit and therefore unseen unless you go back this far. What I don't know I'll learn (for sure I'll be Googling, if that fails StackOverflow) and what I do know I'll share. <br />
  Plus I'm a good teammate. I'll bring good vibes, we'll have fun working together, I promise!</p>

  <h3>Approach Outline</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>I will set up a inital scaffold based on requirements, starting with semantics and styles.</li>
    <li>Regarding styles, throughout my career I have used SMACCS, BEM and Atomic CSS architectures. These serve a great foundation but have become less relevant with a more integrated CSS-in-JS and ultimatly componet first frontend.</li>
    <li>For this task I will try and demonstrate my understanding of CSS architecture but in a limited capacity will have to make a few practical decisons that might conflict, if there are any doubts as to an approach I have taken let's discuss them so I can validate my decision while acknowledging this might not be the right approach for every solution.</li>
    <li>Semantics, my intention is to be fully accessible compliant, minimum using the a11y checklist, no excuss but if there are any gaps it will be due to time constraints - I pride myself on prioriting an often overlook feature of any UI.</li>
    <li>Logic. I have a lot to improve on, consider myself a jack of many, master of less. I've work with jQuery, AngularJS (not the new stuff), Vue, React and in my opinion the most difficult VanillaJS. This app will be VanillaJS. </li>
  </ol>
