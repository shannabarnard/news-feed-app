  <h1>Hire me. Â¡Por favor!</h1>
  <p>This is my initial commit and therefore unseen unless you go back this far. What I don't know I'll learn (for sure I'll be Googling, if that fails StackOverflow) and what I do know I'll share. <br />
  Plus I'm a good teammate. I'll bring good vibes, we'll have fun working together, I promise!</p>
